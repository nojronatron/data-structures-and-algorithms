# Binary Search of Sorted Array

## Goals

This challenge will require building a whiteboard to solve the problem.

### Requirements

Write a function called BinarySearch.
Function will take 2 parameters: An array (sorted) and a search "key".
Function will return the index of the input array's element that is equal to the value of the search key.
If the function cannot locate an equal value it will return integer -1.
Utilize a 'binary search' algorithm to solve this problem.
