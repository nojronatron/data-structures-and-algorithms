# Hashmap Repeated Word

## Feature Tasks

Write a function called repeated word that finds the first word to occur more than once in a string

Arguments: string

Return: string

## Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts
to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm
in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Modify your function to return a count of each of the words in the provided string

- [ ] Modify your function to return a list of the words most frequently used in the provided string
